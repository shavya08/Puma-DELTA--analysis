# Puma-Delta-model-analysis-
Performing the DELTA+ analysis for Puma 

Question 

Choose an organisation that actively uses Analytics (see guidance below on how to choose a suitable organisation).

1. Give a brief introduction to your chosen organisation and to your report.  (100-200 words suggested)
   
2. Evaluate the analytics maturity of your chosen organisation using the DELTA framework.  (1000 words suggested)

3. Describe a potential new Analytics project which your chosen organisation could use as a test case for moving the organisation up the DELTA framework i.e. for improving the analytics capability of your chosen organisation (100-200 words suggested). This must be a new project which does not yet exist, but you can use historical evidence from the companyâ€™s previous projects for guidance and comparison.  (100-200 words suggested)

4. Choose three themes taught on the module to explore how the chosen organisation can further develop its Analytics capability in relation to the proposed new Analytics project. Your analysis should lead to clear recommendations. Themes should be selected from the concepts and methods taught on the module.

Choosing a suitable organisation 

You should choose an organisation that would be rated as between levels 2 and 4 using the DELTA framework. Thus, you should not choose an organisation that could be rated at level 5 (expert user of Analytics) such as AWS, nor should you choose an organisation that could be rated as level 1 (very limited or no experience of using Analytics).
